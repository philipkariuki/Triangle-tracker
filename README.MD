#### By **Philip Kariuki**
## Description
##### Week 2 independent project for Moringa School Prep.
The project entails making a triangle tracker that meets the following criteria to be successful:<br>
<b>Isosceles</b>: If two sides are the same then the triangle is iscosceles.<br>
<b>Equilateral</b>: If all three sides are the same then the triangle is equilateral.<br>
<b>Scalene</b>: If none of the three side match in size then the triangle is scalene.<br>
<b>Not a triangle</b>: Unless the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle cannot be formed.
## BDD
The concept here is to integrate JavaScript to a HTML document. The HTML will cover the front end or user interface to collect data, which is passed to the back-end JavaScript which does the sorting, verifications and logical operations. JavaScript then returns the final output data to the user through the HTML document. 
<p>Therefore user input for triangle measurements are entered through the text field, of which JavaScript will process the input and return the relevant results according to the data it was fed.</p>
